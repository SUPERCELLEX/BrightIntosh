BrightIntosh enables your MacBook Pro M1 (or newer) to use the increased brightness of its XDR display anytime. By default this is only possible when displaying HDR content.
It comes with a handy menu bar menu so you can toggle the increased brightness quick and easy.
This tool should not harm your display as it doesn't use any lowlevel api calls and your OS is in full control over the display.
